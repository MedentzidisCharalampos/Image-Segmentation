# Image-Segmentation
The task of image segmentation is to train a neural network to output a pixel-wise mask of the image.  
 The dataset that will be used for this tutorial is the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/), created by Parkhi *et al*. The dataset consists of images, their corresponding labels, and pixel-wise masks. The masks are basically labels for each pixel. Each pixel is given one of three categories :   
 *   Class 1 : Pixel belonging to the pet.  
 *   Class 2 : Pixel bordering the pet.   
 *   Class 3 : None of the above/ Surrounding pixel.
